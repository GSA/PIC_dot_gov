<h4>Posted May 11, 2017</h4>
  <p><strong>By Jenny Mattingley, Executive Director of the Performance Improvement Council</strong></p>
<p>Transitions are a time of reflection and opportunities as well as a good time to renew relationships and look at new ways to tackle pressing challenges. It is in this spirit that the PIC team stands ready to continue its engagement with the performance community around effective practices and resources.</p>
<p>Along with tackling transition-related opportunities, the PIC team is also undergoing its own internal transition. As you may know, I recently stepped into the role of Executive Director. It is a huge honor to join this community and the talented PIC team especially during this time as we seek to capitalize on the skills, programs and practices that drive strong performance across government.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with and learning from the performance community over the coming months. It may take some time before our paths formally cross, so please feel free to reach out in the meantime - <a href="mailto:PICStaff@pic.gov">PICStaff@pic.gov</a>. As I settle in, the PIC team will continue to provide strong support to the performance community, so please do not hesitate to reach out to them as well.</p>
<p>I will also use this opportunity to recognize and thank Tammy Tippie, the outgoing acting Executive Director for the PIC. During her detail to the PIC she worked diligently to move the needle on government-wide performance practices. While we at the Office of Executive Councils will miss Tammy's expertise, we know that it will be put to good use back at her home agency (DHS) and we look forward to keeping her closely tied to the community.</p>
<p>Finally, this week is also Public Service Recognition Week (PSRW) and yet another good time to reflect on the work federal employees do day in and day out, often unsung. It is also a time to say thank you - &nbsp;for your commitment to improving government performance and for your service to the American people. Your work makes a difference and is appreciated. Please join me in thanking and recognizing all of your colleagues for their service this week.</p>
