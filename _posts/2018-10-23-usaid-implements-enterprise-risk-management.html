          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is implementing a worldwide Enterprise Risk-Management (ERM) process, consistent with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123, to build a systematic, integrated, Agency-wide approach to addressing risk. Breaking down silos, ERM allows leadership to have a holistic view of the risks the Agency faces. The goal is not to control or avoid all risk, but to take advantage of opportunities while reducing or mitigating threats, to maximize USAID’s likelihood of achieving its mission and objectives: reducing the reach of conflict; preventing the spread of pandemic disease; and counteracting the drivers of violence, instability, transnational crime, and other national security challenges.</p>

            <p>In fiscal year 2018, as part of the worldwide implementation of ERM, USAID published its first <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/policy/risk-appetite-statement" target="_blank">Risk-Appetite Statement</a>. The Statement provides staff and implementing partners with broad-based, Agency-wide guidance -- based on an evaluation of opportunities and threats -- regarding the amount and type of risk USAID is willing to accept to achieve its objectives.</p>

            <p>Achieving effective ERM is crucial for USAID. The Agency’s role in support of U.S. foreign policy and national security goals requires that staff and partners work in a wide variety of high-threat environments, in which risks range from state failure and armed conflict, to corruption, natural disaster, and macroeconomic instability.  The ERM governance structure and reporting process is already helping USAID navigate complex risks more effectively. We are confident the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/policy/risk-appetite-statement" target="blank">Risk-Appetite Statement</a> will be an essential guidepost during this transformation.</p>

                  <li><b>Programmatic Risks</b> are events or circumstances that could potentially improve or undermine

                    of interest that could adversely affect the accountability of U.S. taxpayer dollars, or the
