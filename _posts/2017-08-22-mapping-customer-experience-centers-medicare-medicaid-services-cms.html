<p>As part of the PIC’s mission to advance performance improvement in the federal government, we occasionally partner with agencies to help grow in-house capabilities on proven approaches to improve service delivery. &nbsp;Recently, CMS partnered with the PIC team to explore the application of customer journey mapping on its customer-facing operations. &nbsp;Customer journey mapping is a people-centric tool for designing optimal customer experiences. It creates a visual narrative of the customer’s thoughts and emotions along their journey to accomplishing a goal. &nbsp;It shifts our view of a process from the inside-out to the outside-in and helps us understand the customer’s needs and pain points along their journey. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, PIC staff trained and coached a group of CMS employees who took on customer journey mapping projects in three topic areas supporting enhanced customer service for the Medicare and Marketplace programs.</p>
<p>Through this work, teams gained a deeper insight into how customers experience their services (their ups and downs) and identified improvements that will make a big difference in enhancing the customer’s experience. &nbsp;The teams received very positive CMS leadership feedback and sparked a larger conversation on how to best apply customer journey mapping across the CMS enterprise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This PIC/CMS partnership enabled front line teams to demonstrate the power of customer journey mapping in targeting service delivery improvements on the areas that really matter to CMS customers. &nbsp;The application of this citizen-centered approach to performance improvement has tremendous potential to transform service delivery across the federal government. &nbsp;For more information on this effort, please contact Boris at <a href="mailto:boris.arratia@pic.gov">boris.arratia@pic.gov</a></p>
