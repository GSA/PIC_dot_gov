<h4>Posted Jan 22, 2018</h4>
  <p>With the new year upon us, the Performance Improvement Council (PIC) support team is pleased to share the progress we made in 2017 and announce updates and initiatives for 2018.</p>
<h4><strong>2017 End of Year Report</strong></h4>
<p>We are excited to release our first ever <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/sites/default/files/PIC_2017_End%20of%20Year%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>End of Year Report</strong></a>! This past year brought progress and accomplishments for our stakeholders in the federal performance community. The report captures the notable efforts of this community and the support team at the General Services Administration (GSA) as we advanced mission achievement and performance management across the federal government in 2017.</p>
<p>In the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/sites/default/files/PIC_2017_End%20of%20Year%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>report</strong></a>, you will hear from several members of the performance community and get a glimpse into performance management initiatives for the coming year. We hope you find it informative and inspiring!</p>
<h4><strong>Looking Ahead - 2018 Initiatives &amp; Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>Building upon our accomplishments in 2017, the new year provides opportunities to further strengthen the Performance Improvement Council and the support we here at GSA provide our stakeholders in the broader federal performance community.</p>
<p>The Office of Executive Councils, which supports the Performance Improvement Council, is joining forces with the Unified Shared Services Management team. This will allow us to enhance collaboration to better serve our stakeholders and provide stronger, cross-cutting performance management support.</p>
<p>Our 2018 key objectives, outlined below, will guide our efforts to address specific challenges and needs in the federal performance community in the year ahead:
</p><ul><li>Optimize cross-council coordination and service delivery</li>
<li>Deliver useful resources to stakeholders</li>
<li>Unite the performance community</li>
<li>Improve federal performance reporting</li>
<li>Enhance performance and mission achievement</li>
</ul><p>Each objective is supported by key efforts to expand our impact and deliver value through knowledge sharing and capacity building. One of these initiatives, already underway, is updating the PIC.gov website to improve end-user navigation and provide easier access to information, digital tools, and resources. You can learn more about our initiatives for supporting the federal performance community in 2018 in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/sites/default/files/PIC_2017_End%20of%20Year%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>End of Year Report</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to inspiring collaboration and guiding our stakeholders towards stronger performance in 2018, and we will continue to share additional updates on our progress with you throughout the year.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
