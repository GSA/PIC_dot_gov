  <p><em>This blog is the fist in a series of posts that will spotlight the experiences and accomplishments of White House Leadership Development Program fellows and alumni.</em></p>

<p><em>At a recent White House Leadership Development Program (WHLDP) alumni event, we caught up with Jack and asked him about his experience in the program. Here is what he had to say about his experience as part of the 2016 inaugural cohort of fellows.</em></p>

<p align="center"><img alt="WHLDP" src="{{site.baseurl}}/sites/default/files/styles/blog_media/public/blog_media/POTUS%20at%20SES.jpg?itok=ZXjE0Vy3" style="width:600px"></p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 13.008px;">What initially attracted you to the White House Leadership Development Program?</strong></p>

<p>“When I first heard about it, it just sounded like a great way to grow,” Jack says. “I thought this was a good way to better understand the federal government, build my connections, and learn how the inner government worked.”</p>

<p>During his fellowship, Jack worked on an initiative called the Community Solutions Program. This professional development program pairs the best and brightest community leaders worldwide with a U.S. nonprofit organization or local government agency. He described the value of this government-wide experience. “Everyday, I was talking to 15 or 16 agencies. We had four task groups that included all of the cabinet members. So I made connections everyday.”</p>

<p>Jack’s connections immediately proved to be valuable. He was able to recruit one of his high-performing colleagues to join the Department of Transportation and train them as his replacement when he became Senior Executive Service (SES).</p>

<p><strong>How did &nbsp;the program help you earn promotion to the Senior Executive Service?</strong></p>

<p>Jack described WHLDP as a career accelerator and attributes his promotion to the program. “With this program, you really learn how government works and understand how the work you’re doing relates to other places. So when you have a problem, you’re more apt to go out and find a solution that already exists - to crowdsource it - rather than creating a new solution.” He says this type of activity enabled him to significantly expand his breadth of perspective, which was critical to taking the next step in his career.</p>
