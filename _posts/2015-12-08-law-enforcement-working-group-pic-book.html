<p><strong>Measuring Performance&nbsp;in Law Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>Measuring outcomes for law enforcement has been a challenge for the Department of Justice.&nbsp;How do you measure effectiveness when success can mean that nothing bad happened?&nbsp;How do you account for external factors affecting public safety that you don’t control?&nbsp;How do you deal with data lags from the field? How do you deal with overlapping jurisdictions?&nbsp;How do you deal with the restrictions of&nbsp;classified information?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Performance Improvement Council asked if the Justice Department would be interested in co-sponsoring a working group on Law Enforcement Measurement, we jumped at the chance to engage on these issues with the larger federal law enforcement community.&nbsp;The Department, along with other agencies, ideally has been looking for that “silver bullet” -- a way to develop useful law enforcement outcome metrics.&nbsp;While&nbsp;we&nbsp;frequently&nbsp;meet within DOJ to discuss the challenges of crafting law enforcement metrics – we don’t often hear what other agencies are doing to measure law enforcement activities.&nbsp;Establishing the Law Enforcement Working Group&nbsp;provided a great opportunity to brainstorm and discuss some common and not so common challenges around developing metrics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Twelve agencies participated in the working group.&nbsp;As you read through the PIC Book, you’ll see&nbsp;that despite the differences in our agency missions,&nbsp;we&nbsp;discovered common issues related to performance measurement, and discussed many ways to approach these issues.&nbsp;Our discussions touched on some very useful topics: how to present a high-level view of law enforcement outcomes; the use of flowcharts as a way help trace the path between inputs, outputs, and outcomes; methods to explain and deal with long lags either in data or in investigative results; the use of proxy metrics; and many others.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Working Group created a forum, where not only were we able to share&nbsp;some best practices to address various law enforcement measurement issues, agencies realized that they were not the only ones struggling with development of effective and useful metrics.&nbsp;While perhaps we didn’t find a “silver bullet” to address all of our challenges, getting agencies like Transportation, State, Commerce, DHS, etc. into one room to have that dialogue was very productive, and of course a great opportunity for networking.&nbsp;Hope you enjoy the fruits of our labor! &nbsp;</p>
