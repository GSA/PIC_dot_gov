The <b>State Department Program Design and Performance Management Toolkit</b> guides program and project managers through each step of the new policy. Performance specialists continue to conduct outreach and training, including the establishment of a Community of Practice, to assist bureaus in achieving each aspect of the policy. The policy and Toolkit are publicly available for downloading <a href="https://www.state.gov/f/tools/index.htm" target="_blank">here.</a>
