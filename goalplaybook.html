    <h2 style="color:white;">GOAL PLAYBOOK</h2>


<p style="color:white;" >In today’s world, solving big hairy problems requires flexible, cross-functional solutions. The siloed organizational structure of the Federal Government can impede our ability to meet these problems head on. The good news is that we are increasingly working across structures to identify long-standing problems, set clear goals, and implement solutions.</p>

<p style="color:white;">Sports teams use playbooks as a set of strategies to inform how to respond to the situation on the field. This set of plays is designed to help individuals and teams think through how to <span style="color: #28628E; font-weight: bold;">set</span> a goal; develop a <span style="color: #E16740; font-weight: bold;">plan</span> for the way forward; and <span style="color: #F1B828; font-weight: bold;">achieve</span> the goal through execution and continuous refinement of the plan, tracking progress, and continuous improvement. While inspired by the Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal and Agency Priority Goal (APG) processes which identify ambitious, time-limited federal goals, we hope this playbook will be a useful resource when applied to any new goal or initiative.</p>  </div>

      <p>While the plays are broken into three phases — Set, Plan, and Achieve — we see all of these activities as interrelated and interdependent. It’s critical to loop back and forth throughout the phases as you learn more and the environment you’re working in inevitably changes.</p>

      <p>The General Services Administration’s Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement can help you at any point in your goal journey, and if we can’t help you ourselves, we can connect you to excellent resources across government. To that end, you’ll see that each play has a resource section. While external resources (not developed by GSA staff) are not formally endorsed by the staff and definitions may not match our own perfectly, we find them useful. If there is a resource that you think others would find useful, let us know at <a href="mailto:fed2fedsolutions@gsa.gov">fed2fedsolutions@gsa.gov</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Making specific commitments to a limited number of actions and results allows organizations and teams to focus efforts and resources for maximum impact. If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority.

<p  style="text-align:center">While priorities may fluctuate and shift over time, identifying desired outcomes and setting specific goals around those outcomes will give programs a clear, steady purpose. Developing and adhering to goal selection criteria sets organizations and teams up for success by ensuring goals will be relevant over the lifecycle of the goal.</p>

<ul><li>What criteria should be used to select a goal? Which criteria matter more than others? Who sets the criteria and prioritization method?</li>
	<li>What is the goal area(s) that meets your criteria and rises to the top in terms of priority?</li>
	<li>Does the goal clearly address a critical problem and/or opportunity? A set of end customers that are a priority? What do those customers want and need?</li>
<li>Who are the ultimate customers of this goal? What do they want and need</li>
	<li>Would this goal, and the contributing affiliated programs, benefit from elevated attention from leadership, regular monitoring and discussion, and possible public reporting?</li>
	<li>Does the potential implementing program(s) have sufficient authority, resources, and levers to move the needle for the proposed goal?</li>
	<li>Is the goal reflected in the priorities and incentive structures for the implementing agency, teams, and individuals? Is there buy-in throughout the delivery chain? If not, is there potential for this?</li>
	<li>Who will/should champion the goal? How much influence do/will they have among the key stakeholders? (<a href="#play3" title="View Play 3">see “build the goal team”</a>)</li>

  <h2  style="text-align:center" class="set" id="play2">Play 2: Refine the goal statement</h2>
  <p>Once a goal area has been identified, developing a clear goal statement — specific, time-bound, measurable — is critical to framing and articulating the goal and vision of success for internal and external stakeholders. The process of developing the goal statement should cultivate a robust conversation around and decision on what success looks like.</p>
  <h3><strong class="set">Key Questions</strong></h3>
  <ul><li>What is the problem we’re trying to solve? Whose problem is it? How do we know that it’s a problem?</li>
    <li>Why are we doing this? Why does the effort matter?</li>
    <li>How ambitious should the goal be? Attainable to drive achievement? Aggressive to drive improvement? Almost impossible to drive transformation?</li>
    <li>What does the desired future state look like? How will we know we’ve been successful? What is the baseline and target?</li>
    <li>Are the problem, goal, and future state articulated in terms of a clear outcome or target?</li>
    <li>If the following people were to read the goal statement, what do we want them to know? US citizen; media; delivery partner; federal employees in contributing agencies. Does the goal statement speak to each audience? (<a href="#play9" title="View Play 9">see “develop a communications strategy”)</a></li>

	<p>A goal’s success is contingent upon having a limited set of senior leaders in place who are committed to providing vision and support, being a spokesperson for the goal, and delegating authority to make decisions and to take action, while accepting accountability for the goal’s results. Equally as important is a dedicated staff-level team that is given the authority to implement the key strategies over the course of the goal.</p>

	<h3><strong class="set">Key Questions</strong></h3>

		<li>Who are the deputy goal leaders and/or implementation leads who can help drive change over the course of the goal?</li>
		<li>How will this goal be staffed? What mix of knowledge and skills do we need to harness in order to meet or exceed the goal? Where will the people come from? How much time will they need to commit?</li>

    <h2 class="display plan large">PHASE 2: PLAN</h2>

<p>Planning is the act of considering and committing to a path forward in order to coordinate decisions and intended actions. The planning process should include multiple stakeholders, consider the needs of key customers, identify and plan for risk, and take into account timeline and resource constraints. The resulting plan should guide decision-making at both the strategic and operational level and be a living document updated on a regular basis.</p>

	<p>Choosing milestones, measures, and targets that are meaningful — that make sense to people on the team and are logically linked to goals and strategies — will help the goal team track progress towards meeting the goal. Meaningful measures act as gauges to indicate when actions have moved the needle in the right direction or at the pace needed to meet the target within the timeframe. Each progress review can be used as an opportunity to make adjustments to strategies, resourcing, or actions along the way.</p>

	<p>Proactive messaging about plans, progress, challenges, and results to internal and external stakeholders allows teams to discuss progress, get feedback, and keep decision-makers informed.

	<li>Have any new information and insights gained suggest a change to the goal statement? The key measure?</li>
	<li>Is the leadership and goal team still the right group of individuals to be leading and supporting this goal?</li>

	<h2 class="display achieve" id="play11">Play 11: Adjust and innovate</h2>

	<p>As Goal Teams measure and assess progress, they learn more about their ever-changing operating environment and effect of early actions, making it critical to adjust strategies, activities, measures, and milestones. By asking “what’s changed” and questioning early assumptions, Goal Teams can flex, pivot, and adapt. Setting ambitious goals can and should also open the door to experimenting and innovating to test new approaches to program delivery.</p>

		<li>Are we empowered by leadership when we need to make necessary changes? Are there any legal or statutory constraints on making changes?</li>
		<li>Will we actually implement improvements? How would we track their impact?</li>
		<li>Are we ready to rapidly test promising ideas, review test results, and iterate based on such results? Do we have some flexibility in our plans, assessments, and decision-making to account for possible failures?</li>

	<p>Capturing and sharing lessons learned in the pursuit of a goal are often overlooked and undervalued. The value of documenting actions taken, the conditions under which they were taken, and the results are, however, critical in an environment where resources are tight. Knowing what worked or didn’t can help Goal Teams (yours and others) save time and effort in the future.</p>

	<h3 id="key-questions achieve"><strong class="achieve">Key Questions</strong></h3>

	<ul><li>What did we do that worked particularly well? What conditions may have led to those particular successes?</li>
		<li>What would we not try again? Might those things have worked under different conditions?</li>
		<li>Which of our lessons learned may be identified as a promising or best practice?</li>
		<li>Who may benefit from our lessons learned? Other government teams? The public? </li>
		<li>Where should we keep our lessons learned? Who will have access? How will they be updated?</li>
		<li>How will we incorporate lessons learned into regular reviews of progress and adjustments to the goal plan? (<a href="#play11" title="View Play 11">see “adjust and innovate”</a>)</li>
