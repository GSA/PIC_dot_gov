<p>Mr. Moore is a trusted leader and problem solver, with a reputation for managing complex teams, finding common ground, and successfully achieving desired outcomes--skills he will hone in his assignment to the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/">Data, Accountability and Transparency Team</a> in the Office of Federal Financial Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to his selection for the White House Leadership Development Program, Mr. Moore served as the Senior Advisor for Strategic Sealift and led the establishment of the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel Program for the Maritime Administration (MARAD), U.S. Department of Transportation. He was responsible for leading the efforts to develop, justify, and communicate requirements, oversee progressive levels of ship design, and cultivate understanding and support for the program. As with other capital improvement programs he has led, Mr. Moore worked to improve project oversight, governance, and planning, to significantly reduce cost and minimize risk to the federal government. The program&rsquo;s innovative approach to federal vessel acquisition for new construction is estimated to save nearly $2 billion. The potential for savings across the whole government on future recapitalization of non-combatant ships is substantial.</p>
<p>His previous assignments with MARAD include serving as the Transportation Attach&eacute; and Senior Maritime and Intermodal Advisor to the Ambassador at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, Director of Port Infrastructure Development, Director of Gateway Offices, U.S. Senate Fellow, Special Assistant to the Maritime Administrator, and staff at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. He began his service on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Moore earned his B.S. in Marine Engineering from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, an M.S. in Engineering Management, and an M.A. in National Security and Strategic Studies.</p>
