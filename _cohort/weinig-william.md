The primary objective of this CAP goal is to reduce the time between when a government manager says &ldquo;I need&hellip;&rdquo; to the time they say &ldquo;I got&hellip;&rdquo; by identifying efficiencies, proliferating best practices, and making the best use of available data within the full arc of acquisitions undertaken by the federal government.</p>
