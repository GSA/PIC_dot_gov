<p>Mr. Jackson joined the federal government in 2005 as a Presidential Management Fellow where he worked on an effort to significantly change the trajectory of biomedical and behavioral research. In his role as Associate Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund, he oversees the management and operations of a $650M annual budget that supports some of the most innovative programs at the NIH. He creates policies and systems for, and manages the talented teams that oversee, business operations (e.g., grants, contracts, IT, and budget), administration (e.g., workforce management and performance, property, and facilities), communications (e.g., web and social media, outreach strategy, and customer relations), and evaluation (e.g., strategic planning, and process/outcome assessments). When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Mr. Jackson took an additional role in the NIH Immediate Office of the Director to help launch initiatives focused on speeding the development of, and researching unequal access to, new COVID-19 tests and diagnostics.</p>
