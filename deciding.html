              <h3>Play 1: Make Specific Commitments</h3>
              <img src="/sites/default/files/styles/blog_media/public/PerformancePractices02.png">
              <p><b>What is it?</b>  Making specific commitments to a limited number of actions and results in order to focus our efforts and resources for maximum impact. Because if everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority. </p>
              <p><b>What are we aiming for?</b> While our priorities may fluctuate and shift over time, our program and organization has a clear, steady purpose.  This is articulated in clear goals that speak to the mission outcomes we are here to achieve.  We can re-prioritize when it’s needed, but this is something we avoid doing frequently. Generally, people on our team should be able to explain what they do and how it relates to our overall priorities easily. Regardless of our level in an organization and our structure, we are headed in the same direction. </p>
              <h3 id="checklist">Key Questions  (Ask yourself “why/why not” or “how” after each):</h3>
              <ul><li>Do we have clear goals that we are trying to achieve?</li>
                <li>Are goals too limited in number or are there too many to remember?</li>
                <li>Can we easily show how we are achieving our goals</li>
                <li>Are there senior leaders who help us prioritize and who enforce our priorities?</li>

              <h3>Play 2: Determine a path forward</h3>
              <p><b>What is it?</b> Considering and committing to the path forward in order to coordinate delivery decisions.</p>
              <p><b>What are we aiming for?</b> Our plans guide decision-making, both at strategic and operational levels. Our plans are living documents that we refer to or update on a regular basis. The planning processes we use include multiple stakeholders and consider the needs of our key customers, both internal and external to our team. We have a standard way of identifying and planning for risks, and our plans take into account timeline and resource constraints. When we develop plans, we make sure they align to our overall mission or organizational vision. </p>

                <li>Do we have a process to identify and plan for risk?</li>
                <li>Are the plans we work with aligned, or are they contradictory/in conflict?</li>

              <h3>Play 3: Assess Success</h3>
              <p><b>What is it?</b> Assessing the success of goals to determine whether outcomes are being met and to inform policy or programmatic decisions.</p>
              <p><b>What are we aiming for?</b> We want to know that our programs are meeting their intended outcomes so we periodically dive deeper to gather evidence or data that helps us answer that question. We use the best available evidence to rigorously and credibly document program effectiveness, make hard choices, and learn more systematically what works, for whom, under what circumstances. We understand <i>why</i> we expect our program to have impact and we use that insight to inform our strategies, plans and measures. Where evidence is lacking for important policy and program implementation areas, we seek to develop rigorous evidence. </p>

              <ul><li>Do we intentionally assess our success in achieving our goals?</li>
                <li>Are we able to make judgements about our impact with the information available to us?</li>
                <li>Do we take the time to reflect on progress in a structured way?</li>
                <li>Do we adjust or change what we are working on based on thoughtful, rigorous assessments?</li>
