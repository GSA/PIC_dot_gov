<center><p><strong>We consider our customers our partners.</strong><br />
	Together, we help agencies tackle today’s high-priority improvement and transformation challenges<br />
	by leveraging leading practices, tools, and data<br />
	while building the culture, capabilities, and conditions to continue improving tomorrow.</p>

<p><br />
	 </p>

<p>Here are a few examples of the types of Agency Challenges we hear. Each is paired with an example of a F2F Solutions service that we might recommend and provide to you. (This is not an exhaustive list and we quite frequently combine multiple solutions to address a single agency challenge.)</p>

<p><br />
	 </p>

<p><strong>Agency Challenge</strong></p>

<p>“I’ve been asked to lead a new cross-cutting initiative that brings together different parts of my Agency and don’t know where to begin.”</p>

<p><br /><strong>
	F2F Sample Solution</strong></p>

<p>Our facilitators can help your cross-cutting team to define  the vision, strategies, and goals, and decide on performance measures to track your success.</p>

<hr /><p><strong>Agency Challenge</strong></p>

	 </p>

<p><strong>F2F Sample Solution</strong></p>

<p>Our subject matter experts help you identify lessons learned from previous efforts across government and plan for success using our tested framework and best practices for contracts/managing industry.</p>


<hr /><p><strong>Agency Challenge</strong></p>

<p>“I want our organization to be more data-driven, but we lack the analytical skills to do data analysis.”<br />
	 </p>

<p><strong>F2F Sample Solution</strong></p>

<p>Our data analytics team conducts preliminary analysis on government-wide data sets  to identify areas of opportunity.</p>

<p>“We want to undertake a major transformation, but past efforts have failed and I don’t trust industry.”<br />
	 </p>

<p><strong>F2F Sample Solution</strong></p>

<p><br />	 </p>
<p style="font-size:200%;"><strong>Consultations</strong></p>

<p>When you contact us, we will help you discover or refine the root cause of the issue (questions &amp; assessments), what your best path forward might be (options &amp; strategies), specific advice (tools &amp; actions), and referrals to others who might be able to help you. Contact <a href="mailto:Fed2FedSolutions@gsa.gov">Fed2FedSolutions@gsa.gov</a> to request a consultation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p style="font-size:150%;"><strong>Then what?</strong></p>



<center><p><strong>“We can do it ourselves”</strong></p>

<p>In most consultation areas, we can provide you with what you need to handle the issue on your own,</p>

<p>such ad hoc coaching, a short DIY guide, a more robust toolkit, or another information resource.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>“We can learn to do it ourselves”</strong></p>

<p>In some cases, we may provide some train-the-trainer type training and/or periodic advice or support</p>

<p>so that you can learn to effectively &amp; successfully use our</p>

<p>guides, toolkits, workshops, training materials, and programs</p>

<p>to customize &amp; implement your own solutions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>“We could use some help in making progress”</strong></p>

<p>And in other cases, it may be appropriate for us to engage in a more involved partnership over a period of time,</p>

<p>using data &amp; analysis, facilitated engagement, hands-on workshops, working group participation,</p>

<p>to help you convene across perceived boundaries, work through obstacles, and generate momentum.</p>

<p><br />
