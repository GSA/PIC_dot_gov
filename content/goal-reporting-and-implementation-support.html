The identification and establishment of these areas as formal Goals addresses the longstanding challenge of tackling horizontal problems across vertical organizational silos. They are a tool used by leadership to accelerate progress and align activities. The PIC staff works with teams in the Executive Office of the President and across Federal agencies who are leading the CAP Goals, helping to develop and support effective implementation.</p>
<p>Within individual agencies, the PIC staff supports agencies who are implementing Agency Priority Goals and Agency Strategic Goals by providing forums to exchange ideas and improve practices. The PIC is also available to consult with agencies and provide technical expertise and feedback on ways to improve their plannning, measurement and improvement actions. </p>
