    <p><p>Lauren works across a portfolio of federal agencies to improve their practice of performance management and how they report on their progress publicly.</p>
</p>    <p>Her primary role on the team is to help agencies to craft Agency Priority Goals, select measures, and communicate progress. Lauren also leads the team’s efforts to operate and improve performance.gov. Prior to joining the PIC team in March of 2015, Lauren spent eight years using performance management tools as a federal employee for the Navy and as a consultant to federal agencies. She specialized in using analytics and management best practices to drive better value for government operations and better services for US citizens. One of Lauren’s consulting projects was with the PIC back in 2012 and 2013 and she so much enjoyed the community and believed in the work that she jumped at the chance to join the team as a more permanent member. Lauren has an undergraduate degree in Political Science and Marketing and Management from Duke and an MBA from the University of Maryland. She lives in Washington, DC with her husband and twin daughters.</p>  </div>
