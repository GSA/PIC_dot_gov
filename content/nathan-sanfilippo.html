    <p><p>Nathan is an expert in nuclear regulatory policy, licensing, and oversight, which he has developed over his 15 year career at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  He currently serves as Chief of the Hazards Management Branch in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation overseeing the re-evaluation of seismic and flooding hazards facing U.S. nuclear power plants based on lessons learned from the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident in Japan.</p>

<p>Prior to his current position, he served as Chief of the Performance Assessment Branch in the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation where he was responsible for programmatic oversight of the nation’s nuclear power plant inspection program.  Nathan previously served as a Policy Advisor for Nuclear Reactors to the NRC Chairman and as an Executive Technical Assistant to the agency’s Executive Director for Operations.  In each of these roles, he provided policy advice and technical coordination on matters related to nuclear power plant regulation.</p>

<p>In 2011, Nathan was one of six senior-level NRC staff members named to the Near-Term Task Force chartered to evaluate insights from the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident to determine whether changes were warranted for the U.S. nuclear industry.  Earlier in his career, Nathan held various roles at the NRC related to nuclear power plant inspection, emergency preparedness, technical review, and project management.</p>

<p>Nathan earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Materials Science and Engineering from the Pennsylvania State University, a Certificate in Legislative Studies from the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, and a Master of Public Affairs degree from the University of Missouri.  He has been recognized with 19 awards at the NRC and is a graduate of the agency’s Nuclear Safety Professional Development Program and Leadership Potential Program.</p>
