<p>Happy Friday Managers!</p>
<p>We hope you have been finding the bi-weekly trait talks and resources enriching and interesting.</p>
<p>With the final four traits of the Project MGMT series, we wanted to provide some supplemental tools regarding the adoption of a “Growth Mindset” for management. Research suggests that a “Growth Mindset” can support your own development as a manager, as well as your approach to working with your team members.</p>
<p>Below is the first tool to help get you started with a “Growth Mindset.” The worksheet includes some brief background material and an activity that will take less than 5 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>PDF Worksheet: <span class="file"><img class="file-icon" alt="PDF icon" title="application/pdf" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png" /><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/sites/default/files/Growth%20Mindset_1.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=320524">Growth Mindset_1.pdf</a></span></p>
