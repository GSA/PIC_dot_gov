  <p>Dr. Michelle Dorsey is a dedicated public servant, committed to driving excellence and innovation in health care. In addition to helping develop the VA’s sole Breast Imaging Center of Excellence, Dr. Dorsey subsequently broke the glass ceiling as the Phoenix VA’s first female Chief of Radiology. During a time of high-profile crisis, Dr. Dorsey transformed a challenged department into a national leader in providing timely and state- of-the-art radiology care.</p>
  <p> Renowned for her process improvement and change management abilities, Dr. Dorsey was quickly tapped for multiple senior executive positions: Acting Associate and Deputy Directorships at the Phoenix VA, and Acting Associate Director of the VA National Teleradiology Program. More broadly, Dr. Dorsey monitors global health issues and, as a United Nations Observer, has been a delegate at multiple, high-level UN meetings in New York and overseas. A volunteer with RAD-AID International, she develops radiology resources and provides training in underserved countries, with a focus on women’s health and breast imaging.</p>
  <p> Dr. Dorsey is a fellowship trained, board-certified diagnostic radiologist who recently completed an Executive Certificate in Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School. Author of multiple publications and speaker at national and international events, Dr. Dorsey has received multiple honors including being named to the Consumers’ Research Council of America’s “Guide to America’s Top Physicians.” In her new role as a White House Leadership Fellow, she intends to greatly transform the delivery of services by government agencies through improving the customer experience.
