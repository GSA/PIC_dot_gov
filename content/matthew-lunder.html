In this role he investigates and prosecutes violations of federal law affecting competition. His cases range from those involving international cartels and multi-national corporations and their executives in some of the largest investigations in the Division’s history, to local conspiracies in the procurement processes of federal agencies, including the United States Postal Service and the Department of Homeland Security. During his tenure at the Antitrust Division, he has served as the Division’s parallel proceedings expert, and for two years as Counsel to the Director of Criminal Enforcement, assisting the Director and Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement with developing and implementing policy and supporting ongoing antitrust criminal cases at the Division’s five criminal litigating offices throughout the country. He has also served as a Special Assistant United States Attorney at the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland, in the Fraud and Public Corruption Section. Before joining the Antitrust Division, Matthew served as a law clerk at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and at the United States District Court for the District of Montana.</p>
